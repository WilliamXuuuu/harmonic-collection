  <p>Who is William? What do I love?</p>

  <h2>William’s Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    My name is William Xu. I am a sophomore in Communication Design at Parsons
    School of Design. I was born in Shenzhen, China, and I am passionate about
    art, design, and fitness.

  <h2>What I Like</h2>
  <p>
    I love oil painting, creating artwork during my spare time, exploring
    geometry in design, and staying active through strength training and fitness.
  </p>

  <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy walking around the city and discovering unexpected colors,
    patterns, and textures in daily life. These moments often inspire my art.

<h3>Description</h3>

  from early brick phones to flip phones, feature phones, and today’s smartphones.
