  <h2>Entry 2: My Life in New York City</h2>

  <section class="nyc-block">
    <p>
      I am currently studying Communication Design at Parsons School of Design. 
      It has been one year since I moved to New York City, and this year has been full of exciting experiences.

      In this city, I have visited world-class museums, wandered through the streets of SoHo, 
      and even attended fashion shows. These moments not only inspire my creativity but also broaden my understanding of design and culture.

      My life here is also about the everyday: working on assignments, cutting fabric for design projects, 
      exploring new places, and meeting interesting people from all over the world. 
      New York is a place where every day feels like a new story.
